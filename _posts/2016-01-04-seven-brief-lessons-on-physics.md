**Seven brief lessons on physics**

I found this great little book on creativereview.org. I loved its design and the beautiful promotional [website][0]. I read the book during a tube journey through London. It turned out to be a page-turner despite the fact I always disliked physics and never really understood it. 

I can't say I understand more about physics now, but  I took great pleasure in the words, sentences and design features of each essay giving me a glimpse at the beauty of an yet unknown world.  

Physics has never been so beautiful to me. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8994283e-66b3-4f3f-badd-f359926cbc59.png)
